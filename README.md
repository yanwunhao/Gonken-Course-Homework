# Gonken-Course-Homework

#### Task 1

You need to draw TWO line charts with subplots where each subplot has two curves.

Raw data files can be accessed at https://github.com/yanwunhao/FedImT/tree/main/results

Use Matplotlib to draw a graph with two subplots. One for the Tj score contains two lines from Tj_1.txt and Tj_2.txt separately. Another is for the TG score and it also contains two sources: TG_1.txt and TG_2.txt.



#### Task 2

You are required to extract certain specific info from a logging script, then do some transforms and draw them into a line chart.

Raw data files can be accessed at https://github.com/yanwunhao/FedImT/blob/main/experiment_log.txt

The experiment_log_txt is a logging script of a federated learning training process. Please try to extract the ground truth data at each round of training, and draw them into a line chart. X is the round number and Y is the ground truth value. It should contain 10 lines, each line is for each class.



#### Motivation

These tasks are derived from real academic research work during my master's journey that led to a journal publication. They represent typical data visualization challenges that graduate students encounter in their research:
